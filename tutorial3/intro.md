Commands can be transcribed from the left to the terminal on the right or 
clicked.  

If clicked, the command will be run in the terminal on the right and 
you will see the results straight away.  

Always try to type these commands 
yourself as this will make it easier to get the hang of it!

Things we will be covering:


* Overview of how most commands on command line are structured
* What a **man page** is
* How to find the **man page** for a given piece of software (`man`)
* How to read what you need from a **man page**
* Learning some new ways of running `ls` using **man page** info
