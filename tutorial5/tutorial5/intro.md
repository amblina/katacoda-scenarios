In this tutorial we will be learning some small commands to make
dealing with large csv table files (comma-separated value) files easier!  We won't be covering 
all the ways these commands can be used but there will be enough to
get started!


#### Note: 
Commands can be transcribed from the left to the terminal on the right or 
clicked.  

If clicked, the command will be run in the terminal on the right and 
you will see the results straight away.  

Always try to type these commands 
yourself as this will make it easier to get the hang of it!

We will be covering:

* A brief introduction to **file formats** and **file extensions**
* What is a **CSV** and what do they look like?
* How to subset a **CSV** (only show select columns or rows)
