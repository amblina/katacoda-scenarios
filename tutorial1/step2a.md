Let's try running command that exists instead - the``pwd`` command!
 
 ``pwd`` stands for: 
 
 **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory

`pwd`{{execute}}

You should see this output:

`/home/scrapbook/tutorial`

Congratulations you've just run your first command on command line!

 A **directory** is just another name for a folder\*. When you are in a 
 command line environment you are always *somewhere* in the filesystem and 
 this is known as your **working directory**.  This can be a weird concept 
 if you have only used command line before, but you will get used to it
 really quickly - don't worry about it.
