### Don't panic!

Don't worry about running any commands in this environment - you can't break 
anything here!

You can type the commands from the instructions on the left into the terminal
on the right, or you can directly click the commands in the instructions.

If clicked, the command will be run in the terminal on the right and 
you will see the results straight away.  

The command line is case sensitive, so always type commands exactly as given. 
For more complex commands spaces are important as well.

Always try to type these commands yourself as this will make it easier to 
get the hang of it!

Things we will be covering:


* How to run **commands** in a **terminal window**
* What a **working directory** is
* Find out where you are in the filesystem (`pwd`)
* How to list the contents of a directory (`ls`)
* How to make a directory (`mkdir`)
* How to change into a new directory (`cd`)
* Briefly touch upon **absolute** and **relative** paths
