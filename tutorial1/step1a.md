A <strong>prompt</strong> will be displayed in the terminal window on 
the right. A prompt is a set of characters printed on the screen that show you 
where you will be writing your commands.  It also tells you that the command 
line is ready to process your instructions.

Prompts will look slightly different on different systems but for this 
tutorial they will be:

`>` or `$`

To instruct your terminal to do something, you need to enter specific commands 
and press enter.  

### Don't panic!

Don't worry about running any commands in this environment - you can't break 
anything here!

Let's try running a command that doesn't exist:

`hello`{{execute}}

You should get the following message telling you what you already know:

`bash: hello: command not found`

This error message is telling you **what** is complaining and **why**.  Error 
messages happen all the time and are not necessarily a bad thing. Some are 
helpful and descriptive and can tell you what you need to do instead.

The error message is telling you that `bash` (the command line interpreter - 
the software that executes your commands) has an issue with the command 
`hello` and that issue is that the command `hello` doesn't exist.

That's all pretty sensible and boring!

###Â Tasks

1) Try running some silly made-up commands

Here are some ideas!
* `hello world`{{execute}}
* `qwerty`{{execute}}
* `123`{{execute}}
